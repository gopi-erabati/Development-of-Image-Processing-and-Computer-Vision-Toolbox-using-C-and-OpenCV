# Development-of-Image-Processing-and-Computer-Vision-Toolbox-using-C-and-OpenCV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. OpenCV is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.
In this project I aimed at developing of CV tools like feature matching, camera caliberation etc using OpenCV and C++.
